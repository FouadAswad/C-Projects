Assignment 5
This program takes an odd number as input and outputs a magic square to the order of the odd number inputted
*/

/*

This program follows a set of rules to assign the correct numbers to the magic square at [i][j],
these rules were estblished by Simon de la Loub√®re (1642-1729) and consist of the following:

1. Assign the middle variable of the top most row to 1.(magic[0][n/2])
2. From the place established by the first rule, go up a row and go right an element(i--,j++) in magic array
3. If, after step 2, i < 0, set i to bottom most row of j coloumn and set that element of the magic array to the last number set + 1, otherwise go to step 4
4. If, after step 2, j is more than or equal to n, where n is the order of the magic square, set j to leftmost coloumn(0) and assign that element the last number set +1
5. If magic[i][j] arrives at an element that is already set, add 1 to the coloumn of the previously set element and set that element to the last element set + 1
6. If i < 0 AND j >= n, where n is the order of the magic square, repeat sequence of actions for step 5.
